# Services

I offer personalized, mobile speech-language services designed to support each child’s unique communication journey. My services include comprehensive assessments, family-centered consultations, and engaging therapy sessions—all delivered in your child’s natural environment.

I specialize in the following areas:

* Speech sound development
* Language support for early and school-age learners
* Fluency and stuttering support
* Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems
* Neurodiversity-affirming, strengths-based therapy approaches

Every child deserves to be heard and understood. At Goldfinch Speech and Language Services, I’m here to help their voice take flight.
