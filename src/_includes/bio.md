# About me

I’m Arianne Crossley, a registered speech-language pathologist passionate about helping children express themselves confidently, no matter where they're at.

I specialize in working with preschool and school-age children, bringing speech and language therapy directly to them through mobile services. Whether it’s at home, in daycare, or another familiar setting, I meet kids where they’re most comfortable to create a fun, supportive space for growth and communication.

With a child-centered, play-based approach, I focus on building strong, trusting relationships with both children and their families. Every child is unique, and I’m committed to helping each one reach their full potential through personalized, engaging therapy.

When I’m not in sessions, you’ll usually find me out in my garden, hanging out with my wonderful family, or maybe making a little music.
