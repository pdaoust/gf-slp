I gratefully acknowledge that I live, work, and play on the beautiful traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the [Suknaqinx Peoples](https://syilx.org/). I feel deeply privileged to live here and recognize the ongoing stewardship of the land by Indigenous communities, past and present. I am committed to listening, learning, and approaching my work with respect and humility.
